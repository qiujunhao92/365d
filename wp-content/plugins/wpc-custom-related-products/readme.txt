WPC Custom Related Products allows you to choose custom related products for each product.

== Description ==

**WPC Custom Related Products for WooCommerce** is a super easy plugin for creating a custom list of recommended products on single product pages. Itâ€™s a simple but powerful tool for boosting cross-selling on your site.

By refining the related product list, store owners are entitled to promote products from the same collection or other product lines better, while making it easier for customers to find what they need easily or might be interested in. This, thus, offers a better chance for increasing order value and revenue.

- Drag & drop to rearrange the order of items
- Search configurations: search limit, search by SKU, exact or sentence search
