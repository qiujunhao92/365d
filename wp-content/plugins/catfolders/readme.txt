==⚡️ FEATURES ==
After installing and activating **WP Media Folders**, you will have an integrated folder tree right inside the WordPress media library.

**Unlimited folders**
With WP Media Folders - CatFolders Lite version, you will be able to create unlimited main folders and freely move them to the position you want.

**Import categories from other WP media folders plugins**
Are you considering migrating to CatFolders? We've got it covered! With CatFolders, importing your established folder structure is simple and takes only one click. You will then be able to find your familiar categories in CatFolders-fashion.

**CatFolders** supports easy folder import from these plugins:

1. FileBird by NinjaTeam
2. Enhanced Media Library by wpUXsolutions
3. WordPress Media Library Folders by Max Foundry
4. WordPress Real Media Library by Devowl
5. WP Media Folder by JoomUnited
6. HappyFiles by Thomas Ehrig
7. Folders by Premio
8. Wicked Folders

**Works with [Media Library Assistant](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/)**
CatFolders enhances **Media** > **Assistant** admin submenu and supports the `[mla_gallery]` shortcode.
`[mla_gallery mla_catf_folder="120"]`
`[mla_gallery mla_catf_folder="120" attachment_category=mla-category]`

**Drag and drop multiple files**
You can bulk select and drag & drop many files at once to put them in a destination folder. Folders can be bulk selected as well.

**SVG support**
Simply enable uploading SVG and other vector file types with sanitization included!

**Remember recently opened folder**
CatFolders comes with a variety of options to decide which folder to be opened on your first visit. You can choose to get back to your **most recent folder**, or always back to a specific folder, such as "Uncategorized" or "All files."

**Collapsible folder sidebar**
The sidebar reserved for the folder tree can be collapsed so that you can have the full-screen view of the WP media library when needed.

**Upload files to a specific folder**
The enhanced **media library uploader** allows you to choose a folder first and then upload multiple files from your computer to that folder. You can also **bulk-upload many folders** from your storage to WordPress media library in a single drag-and-drop.

**Works with Grid & List view**
All files in a selected folder are sortable in **list mode**, which means you can easily sort your file list by file name, author, date, and custom post type where they are uploaded to.
In **grid mode**, CatFolders works great both in the media library and in the page/post editor. This helps you choose the media files you need for the work-in-progress content much faster than working with an unorganized media library.

**API for developers**
REST APIs allow external plugins to perform specific actions, such as getting folder structure or triggering automated tasks.

== 😻 WHAT'S THERE IN WP MEDIA FOLDERS PRO? ==

**Advanced sort options**
Once upgraded, you will be able to sort files by file name, created date, modified date, author, newest or oldest, etc. Whether you want to sort files and folders by default, or temporarily, there’s always a sorting method for you.

**Create subfolders**
Each subfolder is a child of the parent folder that is above it. With [CatFolders Pro](https://wpmediafolders.com/), a main folder can hold unlimited subfolders. The parent/child analogy helps you organize your files more efficiently. It's very easy to hide or show all folders below the selected folder.

**Folder access permissions**
Enable global folder structure where everyone sees the same categorization, or set folder permissions based on user roles. Access permissions include add new, view, and edit folders. Recommended for multi-author blogs, multi-vendor marketplace websites, and ecommerce businesses.

**Third-party themes and page builders**
Not every theme and plugin has the same way of building, we work hard to deliver extra compatibility. So WP Media Folders will work with these builders throughout your website building stage:

- Gutenberg
- Elementor
- WPBakery
- Visual Composer
- Themify
- Divi Builder by Elegant Themes
- Thrive Architect
- Beaver Builder
- Oxygen
- Cornerstone Page Builder
- Tatsu Builder
- Bricks – Visual Site Builder for WordPress
- Brizy WordPress Builder
- Fusion Page Builder
- And many more!

== 👋 WHY USE CATFOLDERS? ==

A typical WordPress media library looks like a cluster of thousands of multimedia files. They are placed in year and month folderized order, and it can be really hard to find a specific image in a published page or post. 

With WP Media Folders—CatFolders, you can categorize existing attachments and new uploads using a drag-and-drop user interface.

2. From your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **Plugins** > **Add New**, and upload the catfolders.zip file
3. Install and activate it
4. After activating, just go to **WordPress Media** > **Library** to create your first folder/category.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does CatFolders create folders in my WordPress media library? =
This plugin creates virtual folders for your own view. It doesn't make changes to your physical media folders or affect your media file URLs.

= Can I create unlimited folders? =
Yes, with CatFolders - WP Media Folders, you can add unlimited media folders and they are all accessible while you edit page/post using WordPress page builders. 

= Can it remember my last opened folder? =
Yes, please go to **Settings**, open **Startup folder**, select **Previous folder** to make sure it will automatically take you to the recently opened WordPress media library folder to pick up where you left off.

= Can any users create and make changes to the folders? =
It is under the admin's control. As an administrator, you can choose to have private folder structure for each user. Which means a user can view/edit those folders created by themselves, and cannot view/edit those folders created by other users.

= I created all the folders and put all the images in the right place, then realised this view is only available to me. When I turn User-based folders OFF, the folders disappear, even for me. Is there a way to make the folders I created with User-based folders on, to be available to everyone?
Hi, as an admin user, you can merge your user-based folders into "common folders". Here are the steps: [Exporting the CSV](https://wpmediafolders.com/docs/settings/backup-restore-folders/), changing the user number at the "created_by" column to zero, and uploading it again makes the folders available to everyone.


= Do you offer lifetime license in the Pro version? =
Yes, [CatFolders - WP Media Folders Pro](https://wpmediafolders.com/) comes with lifetime licenses for single website or unlimited websites. It is loved by many freelancers and WordPress agencies.
